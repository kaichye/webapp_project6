# webapp_project6
Inside the `project6` folder there are two folders: `client` for React and `server` for Express.

### Server Folder
`$ npm start`
The DB connection has only worked for us on the VPN

### Client Folder
`$ npm run dev`
(May need to `npm install vite` for it to work properly)

### Browser
Visit `http://localhost:5173` to get to the login page.

### Packages
The web app utilizes the react-router-dom and bcrypt packages.
